          <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a Student Computer Engineer currently pursuing my degree at Cal Poly SLO. My academic journey has been marked by a profound passion for Web Development and Software Engineering, as well as a relentless pursuit of best practices in front-end architecture. Beyond the classroom, I thrive on learning the intricacies of unfamiliar systems, always striving to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I'm not immersed in code and algorithms, you'll find me on the sports field, fueled by my love for playing sports. But perhaps the most cherished moments in life involve hanging out with friends, where I find inspiration, relaxation, and the best of times. With a proven track record of effective collaboration in cross-functional teams and a strong commitment to driving project success through technical expertise, I am highly motivated and enthusiastic about contributing to the triumph of dynamic organizations. Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
